### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am entering my second studying Computer Science (MEng) at the University of Southampton this September.
I have created projects in Java (javafx and maven projects), Python and C#.
I want to work on a project with C and I would like to create my own website.
I now have a semi-working version for my swim time management system.
Due to being back in university, work on projects will be less often unfortunately.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C and Haskell.
- I' currently looking into using flutter for a UI for applications
