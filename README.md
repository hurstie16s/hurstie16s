### Hi there 👋

I am entering my second studying Computer Science (MEng) at the University of Southampton this September.
I have created projects in Java (javafx and maven projects), Python, C# and Haskell.
I want to work on a project with C and I would like to create my own website.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Dart and Haskell.
- I' currently looking into using flutter for a UI for applications
