### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am entering my second studying computer science at the University of Southampton this september.
I have created projects in Java (javafx and maven projects), Python and C#.
I now have a semi-working version for my swim time management system.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C and more Java
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a java application to act as a task / project organiser and a calender in one. This is because I want something to help organise my time and I am bored so I thought it would be fun.
