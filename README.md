### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am entering my second studying Computer Science (MEng) at the University of Southampton this September.
I have created projects in Java (javafx and maven projects), Python and C#.
I want to work on a project with C and I would like to create my own website.
I now have a semi-working version for my swim time management system.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C, more Java and I am begining to learn web developement.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a java application to act as a task / project organiser and a calender in one. This is because I want something to help organise my time and I am bored so I thought it would be fun.
