### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a first year Uni Student (as of 2021) studying computer science at the University of Southampton.
I have created projects in Java (javafx and maven projects), Python and C#.
I am currently learning more java and starting to learn C.
I have some ideas for projects to work on after my uni exams are finished in May.
