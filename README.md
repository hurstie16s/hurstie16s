### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

4th year student studying for MEng Computer Science at the University of Southampton.  
Top Languages:
 - Go
 - C
 - Python

Interested in automation, cryptography, backend software development and cybersecurity.  
I prefer to build things instead of theorising about their design and how/ if they would work.

Completed my Part III Individual Project on IoT Virtualisation for Security Testing, developing the AutoEMU tool.
Received a 1st

Currently working on a project to implement lattice-based cryptography in Go without the use of cryptographic libraries.
